To build the project, you need to have Java 21 installed.

## OpenAPI

This project uses OpenAPI to document the API and generate the server code.
The OpenAPI specification is located in the `openapi/openapi.yaml` file.
You can read up on OpenAPI and the specification [here](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3) and use the
[Reference Guide](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/v3_0/about/) by Swagger.

To generate the server code we are using the OpenAPI Generator via the Maven plugin.
You can find the documentation for the Java generator [here](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators/java/).

If you want to run the project for the first time or have made changes to the OpenAPI specification, you need to
generate the server code. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
./mvnw clean install
```

After generating the server code, you can run the project as described above.
While the project is running, you can access the Swagger UI at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html

> **Note:** If you are using an IDE, you might have to set `target/generated-sources/openapi/src/main/java` as a
> generated sources root to avoid compilation errors.
